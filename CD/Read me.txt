Contents of CD accompanying "Paul Wilmott On Quantitative 
Finance, Second Edition."

There are three folders on the CD, "Spreadsheets and VBA," 
"Standalones" and "Wilmott magazine Lyceum."

In the "Spreadsheets and VBA" folder There are 30 Excel 
workbooks. Each corresponds to a chapter of "Paul Wilmott 
On Quantitative Finance". (Many chapters don’t have 
workbooks.) Each workbook typically has several sheets. 
In order to run some macros you may need to install an 
add-in to Excel called Solver. When you install Excel, 
the standard installation does not include this add-in. 
If Solver is not installed you will need to re-run the 
Excel setup program and select this component before the 
macros will work. C++ versions of some of these programs 
are also available, just email paul@wilmott.com if you 
would like these emailed to you.

In the "Standalones" folder there are nine simple programs 
useful for calculating various simple quantities, such as 
option values, greeks etc.

In the "Wilmott magazine Lyceum" folder are 16 Lyceum 
articles from Wilmott magazine in pdf form.

As always, email paul@wilmott.com if you have any problems.
